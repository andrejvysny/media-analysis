### Quick Summary

The script already **copies safely** (temp file + atomic rename), keeps a **SQLite journal**, and runs again after an interruption.
Below are the strong points, the weak spots, and concrete changes—ordered by how much they improve **data-integrity**.

## 1.  What works now

| Capability                      | How the code meets it                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Large data                      | Streams in 1 MiB chunks, no full file read into RAM.                                               |
| Resumable after crash           | `.part` file is reopened at the previous size; finished files are marked in **copy\_progress.db**. |
| No data loss during normal flow | Source is deleted **only after**: copy → hash → rename → `copystat` → journal mark.                |
| Can be stopped / re-started     | `SIGINT/SIGTERM` set `_stop`; current file finishes, then the loop exits.                          |
| Success check                   | Size + SHA-256 match (`verify`).                                                                   |
| Corruption check                | Full-file SHA-256 after copy.                                                                      |

## 2.  Gaps & Risks

| Area                               | Problem                                                                                                                                                       | Why it matters |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Durability to power loss**       | `fsync()` **not** called on the temp file *before* hashing, nor on the final file after rename. Data may still only be in the page-cache. � cite turn0search5 |                |
| Directory durability               | After deleting the source file, its parent directory is **not fsynced** – deletion could be rolled back by a sudden crash.                                    |                |
| Verification accuracy              | Because the temp file is hashed *before* it is flushed to disk, you may hash cached data instead of the on-disk blocks.                                       |                |
| Journal durability                 | SQLite default is `synchronous=NORMAL`; a crash can lose the most recent “done” mark.                                                                         |                |
| Very large trees                   | `rglob("*")` on every start touches **every inode** even if 99 % is already moved. For millions of files this is slow.                                        |                |
| Hash speed                         | SHA-256 doubles I/O. Terabytes == hours of extra disk reads.                                                                                                  |                |
| Hard-links, symlinks, device nodes | `Path.is_file()` follows links; the link itself is not preserved. Special files are skipped silently.                                                         |                |
| Parallel runs                      | Nothing prevents two processes from working on the same source.                                                                                               |                |
| Sparse files                       | `open()/write()` turns holes into real blocks – space blow-up.                                                                                                |                |
| Very large single files            | 1 MiB buffer keeps throughput far below disk speed (especially NVMe).                                                                                         |                |
| Repeated hash failures             | `verify` failure only prints **HASH FAIL**; the next run will keep failing forever.                                                                           |                |
| ACL / xattr / SELinux              | `shutil.copystat` does not copy extended attributes.                                                                                                          |                |
| Cross-device rename                | If **destination** is an SMB/NFS mount on a different device, `tmp.rename(dst)` will raise `OSError`, stopping the run.                                       |                |
| SQLite read into RAM               | `done = {Path(r[0]) ...}` loads the set of all completed files—many gigabytes for millions of paths.                                                          |                |

## 3.  High-priority fixes (data-integrity first)

> **Bold = safest minimal change you *must* do.**

1. **Flush data → fsync → hash**

   ```python
   with tmp.open("ab" if done else "wb") as fout:
       ...
       fout.flush()
       os.fdatasync(fout.fileno())      # NEW
   ```

   Hash *after* the fdatasync.
   **Reference:** the write must reach the platters before you rely on it ([lwn.net][1]).

2. **fsync the final file as well**

   ```python
   tmp.rename(dst)
   os.fdatasync(os.open(dst, os.O_RDONLY))  # NEW
   fsync_path(dst.parent)
   ```

3. **fsync the source directory after unlinking**

   ```python
   src.unlink()
   fsync_path(src.parent)                 # NEW
   ```

4. **Harden SQLite**

   ```python
   self.conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")
   self.conn.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=FULL")   # NEW
   ```

   WAL + FULL survives power loss ([man7.org][2]).

5. **Handle verify failure deterministically**
   *If hash fails:*

   * delete the `.part` file
   * mark journal as failed (new column)
   * continue; avoid infinite loop.

## 4.  Performance & scalability improvements

| Fix                                                                                                                                | Why |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| 🔹 **Hash while copying** – compute hash in the same read loop to avoid the second full read.                                      |     |
| 🔹 Swap SHA-256 for **BLAKE3** (3-5× faster CPU-side).                                                                             |     |
| 🔹 Use `os.sendfile`, `shutil.copyfileobj` with a 16-64 MiB buffer, or `copy_file_range` on kernels ≥ 5.3 to reach disk line-rate. |     |
| 🔹 Detect sparse files (`os.seek(fd, 0, os.SEEK_HOLE)`) and use `copy_file_range` + `SEEK_DATA/HOLE` to preserve holes.            |     |
| 🔹 For millions of files:                                                                                                          |     |
| *Query the DB* instead of `rglob("*")`. Example:                                                                                   |     |

```sql
SELECT src FROM progress WHERE done=0
```

🔹 Batch DB commits (every N files) while keeping `PRAGMA synchronous=FULL` to reduce fsync overhead.|

---

## 5.  Functional hardening  

- **Lock file** (`fcntl.flock`) in the DB or destination dir to block concurrent runs.  
- **Fallback to `shutil.move`** if `rename` raises `EXDEV` (cross-device).  
- **Copy extended attributes & ACLs** (`os.listxattr`, `os.getxattr`, `os.setxattr`).  
- **Handle symlinks**: copy link itself (`lstat` + `os.readlink`) or record as special.  
- **Skip special files** with a clear log entry.  
- **Rescan orphaned `.part` files** on start; ask user or auto-clean when older than N days.  
- **Unit-test** corruption scenarios with dm-fault-inject or a loopback mount.

---

## 6.  Optional comfort & speed

- **Parallel workers** (thread-pool or `asyncio.to_thread`) – keep one writer per disk to avoid head thrash.  
- **Progress persistence**: store aggregated totals (bytes done) in the DB to resume the global bar instantly.  
- **CLI flags**: `--hash {sha256,blake3,none}`, `--buffer-size`, `--max-workers`.  
- **Dry-run / verify-only mode**.  
- **Verbose JSON log** for auditing.

---

### Minimal patch set

If you implement only **four lines** (fsync temp, fsync dest, fsync src.dir, and `PRAGMA synchronous=FULL`) the tool becomes *crash-safe* on ext4/XFS with ordered or journal mode. Everything else is about speed, scale, and edge-cases.

---

### Key take-away  

> **Always fsync both the data file *and* the containing directory.**  
> Atomic `rename()` is durable **only after** those fsyncs :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

With the listed changes the script will safely survive sudden power cuts, handle petabytes, and restart instantly without risking data loss or silent corruption.
